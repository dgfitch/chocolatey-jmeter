# JMeter Chocolatey package

Just what it sounds like. For JMeter 2.12. Only adds JMeter itself to the path 
as a batch file... somewhat clumsy, but a start.


## JMeter releases

For some reason, when JMeter upgrades, the old versions go offline from their 
mirrors. If anyone wants to figure out a better way to maintain this, feel 
free to fork and take over.
